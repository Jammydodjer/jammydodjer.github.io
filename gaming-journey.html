          <div class="text-segment">
<p>This is my first attempt at a blog post and was intended to start as a placeholder but very quickly expanded. Apologies if it is very long or seems dry but I had a lot of fun reminiscing and writing up my experiences and hope you enjoy the insight.</p>
<hr>
<h4>In the beginning...</h4>

<p>Starting from Lego Star Wars: the Complete Saga on the Wii, there are many video games that have left a lasting impression on me. The most recent of which is Hollow Knight, one of the most successful indie games of all time, but there is a long timeline of games that have ensnared my attention and still hold a special place in my heart. Growing up in the 2010s heavily influenced which games I played as a child. For a long time my only console was a Wii, although I recall getting a huddle tablet as my first personal device. </p>

<p>Lego Star Wars: the Complete Saga was the game I played most on the Wii, cementing my childhood obsession with Star Wars. A game that until 2017 was the best selling video game of both Lego and Star Wars franchises, it cemented its place in history with timeless graphics, smooth gameplay and accessible difficulty. A masterclass in executing large scope projects without sacrificing detail or player experience, few other Lego games have come close to replicating what this game perfected in 2007. Some of my earliest memories are tied to specific levels of this game and I have since revisited it, finding the puzzles and humour still engaging in a way few child marketed games can achieve. </p>

<p>Minecraft is the obvious contender for the most influential game of my childhood. To this date it is the best selling video game of all time, having sold more copies than the entire population of the USA. Combined with the virality of popular Minecraft YouTubers, I spent countless primary school break times talking with my friends about Minecraft. It has become such a global phenomenon that it is more noteworthy to have never played Minecraft so there is little to add here.</p>

<p>Once I had access to my own hudl tablet, I began playing mobile games more frequently. While these are often overlooked by the gaming community, I believe there is a lot to be said for the impact some mobile games have had over the years, particularly for their accessibility and wider range of audiences than console or PC games.</p>

<p>Dumb Ways to Die was a classic with a song I can recall even now. This game got away with pushing the boundary of child friendly gore by spreading positive messages about safety. Although it was met with some skepticism and criticism at release, this game taught me never to put a fork in a toaster and other lessons that are never taught in school.</p>

<p>Clumsy Ninja holds a lot of nostalgia for me, a game where you train and play with a ninja who has a habit of rag-dolling. It is a beautiful and simplistic game that I have since revisited and completed, finally seeing the end cutscene I never reached as a child. </p>

<p>Angry Birds: Star Wars took the simple success of a game about slinging birds at pigs and added new mechanics, iconic characters, a reversed campaign and new levels of challenge. A wonderful game with excellent artwork and game design that I loved growing up. Unfortunately it is no longer available to install due to the licensing expiring, a tragedy for the mobile gaming world. </p>

<p>Many mobile games I played as a child are examples of successful game design and hold both my nostalgia and my admiration. There are many more than I could list but these were the ones that left the greatest impression on me. I was never allowed to play Roblox and my access to YouTube was limited so I was sheltered from both the great successes and widespread dangers that these platforms impressed upon many of my peers. </p>

<p>Moving on to the next step of my gaming journey, I first experienced a (non-Wii) console game while on holiday when I played a Spyro game for about 20 minutes. I had never seen anything like it before and desperately wanted to play it again but never managed to. I ended up with a Spyro character for Skylanders but also never ended up with a Skylanders game to use it on. This was my first time using a typical controller and first time playing a single-player RPG so while I never returned to it, this game was a precursor to much of what I enjoy today.</p>

<h4>Introducing the console</h4>

<p>In early high school, I got an Xbox 1 and with it my proper start to console gaming. </p>

<p>Forza Horizon 3 was the first driving game I ever played and, accompanied by its sequel Forza Horizon 4, remains one of the few racing games I have played. My first true experience with a AAA game, Forza set a high precedent with smooth performance, stunning graphics and an unrivalled soundtrack. Little comes close to that feeling of cruising across the open world at top speed while Chase & Status play on the radio. </p>

<p>Another worldwide sensation that I watched unfold firsthand was the release of Fortnite. Although I only played it minimally, it still shocks me to reflect on how much money my friends spent on cosmetics. Using a monetisation system so successful that almost every game since has attempted to replicate it, Fortnite pioneered at every turn when it came to marketing and profiteering. Watching what was an alpha release for a co-op zombie survivor game evolve into the juggernaut of digital concerts, licensed IPs and user generated content that Fortnite has become was surreal every step of the way. </p>

<p>Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order was the game that showed me everything I look for in a game today. Large open world areas, souls-like gameplay, fluid and unique combat and a story that could rival any of the films. Every minute of this game is enjoyable and everything feels polished. An effigy to everything AAA games should aspire to be, its sequel fell at every hurdle that this game soared above. The only thing holding this game back from being one of my favourites of all time is the price tag and the current state of the Star Wars IP.</p>

<p>Titanfall 2 left my expectations of dynamic movement so high that nothing has rivalled it since. Every aspect of this game encourages you to move and that is what this game does perfectly. From level design to enemy design to weapon design, it all feeds back into getting you to keep moving. The movement itself feels unbelievably fluid and is forgiving enough to be accessible to inexperienced FPS players like my younger self but has such a high skill ceiling that you can always improve. Combined with one of the best robotic characters of all time and a gripping campaign, this game takes the crown of my favourite FPS game ever. </p>

<p>SUPERHOT is the most innovative shooter I’ve played in years. A shockingly simple art style, a harrowing narrative and a unique twist on the gameplay makes this game an experience I will never forget. </p>

<p>During the pandemic, I caught Covid over Christmas and moved the Xbox into my room. I installed Life is Strange and proceeded to play it from start to finish in two days. That 12 hours of gameplay had me obsessed for months. No other game has played my heartstrings as much as this one. Every character has such depth and humanity and the story is a perfect balance of heartwarming and chilling. This game explores themes of grief, helplessness and nostalgia in a very real, unfiltered manner. Partnered with the beautifully abstracted graphics, (a charm that was lost somewhat in the remastered version) this game showed me that video games are a unique art form that can draw you into a world in a way no other medium quite can.</p>

<p>Moving on to recent years, I got a laptop for my computer science A-level work that would (just barely) allow me to play PC games for the first time. With my limited processing power and conservative budget, I found myself mostly playing older or indie games. At a similar time I was also gifted an old PS2 and PS3 from a friend who no longer used them so visited a few random games from the past. </p>

<p>On the PS2, I played Tomb Raider: Angel of Darkness, an insight to a time when camera angles were a luxury and textures were just images on flat surfaces. Although significant change of pace from what I am used to, I enjoyed this game until hitting a soft-lock due to a bug with a door keypad. My other experience of this franchise was Rise of the Tomb Raider, a game that mirrored a lot of the experience of Jedi Fallen Order but lacked its quality of story and end-game content. I had good fun with the exploration, side quests and shooting but the main story and general level design felt uninspired. </p>

<p>The other blast from the past on the PS2 I played was Metal Gear Solid 2. I thoroughly enjoyed the humour and characters in this game, a staple that proves how Metal Gear cemented its place in gaming history. As a stranger to stealth games, I was regularly reminded that you are meant to sneak around not fight your way through, but I found the boss fights to be a fun challenge allowing you to unleash some more firepower. Definitely a franchise I plan on returning to and a game that has stood the test of time. </p>

<p>As many people were, I was introduced to the Elder Scrolls franchise through Skyrim, first playing it on the PS3. I ended up buying a bundle of all Elder Scrolls games 1-5 and had great fun trying each game to see how they have evolved over the years. I may make a blog post in the future going into more detail on the evolution of Elder Scrolls games as I could go on for hours. These games have, in my eyes, defined what it means to be a high fantasy RPG and, aside from the admittedly dated graphics, many of the older games are still enjoyable today. </p>

<h4>Current obsessions</h4>

<p>We are approaching the end of my gaming journey, a long and varied list of experiences that have all contributed to who I am and what I play today. If you are still reading, I commend your perseverance and would love to talk with you about any of the games in this list you may have played. With that said and done, let’s move on to the games that are currently capturing my heart and playtime.</p>

<p>Toby Fox is one of my idols and an extremely talented game developer and composer. Undertale and more recently Deltarune are games that captured the hearts of me and my friends, generating great success in sales and an almost cult following amongst its fans. In particular, I admire and enjoy the music in these games. Every track is tied to a character or area and they evoke such emotion and recognition that the characters seem more defined by their theme than the themes seem based on the characters. The cult-following and quality fan content inspired by these games show how video games have widespread impact and the LGBT+ representation in the games have created an inclusive and safe space in the fanbase. Staying up with my friends until 2am playing Deltarune chapters 3 and 4 is a memory I cherish, demonstrating the true connection video games can create.</p>

<p>Hollow Knight is a game I have invested 200+ hours into and for many good reasons. One of the most successful indie games of all time with over 15 million sales with a sequel that hit the news for crashing the store of every platform it was available on by sheer demand, Hollow Knight is a true masterpiece that demonstrates how games are at there best when treated as art. Created by a team of three for the love of game development, Team Cherry focused on doing what they loved most and taking the time they needed to design every enemy and hand draw every element of the game. Silksong mirrors the love and devotion that was put into Hollow Knight, taking 7 years to craft and providing a true sequel to the beloved original. The hand drawn artwork shines in Hollow Knight, creating beautiful and unique visuals in every unique area. The music is also hauntingly beautiful, matching the mood of every moment, be it solemn, spooky or dramatic. The gameplay itself is challenging but fluid, embracing the feeling that every error could be avoided until the last moment, never once leaving the player frustrated at the game for being unresponsive. The game is punishing but also a masterclass in training the player to improve their skill through trial not tutorial. Nearly every boss will take multiple attempts but can be made easier by coming back later, artfully combining aspects of souls-like and metroidvania games in a way that will make every player feel both challenged and rewarded. The achievements, end-game content and hidden secrets make the game endlessly replayable and the haunting lore and emotive characters create a fantastic balance between mystery and hope in the world of Hallownest. Arguably my favourite game, Hollow Knight is an undeniably influential piece of art that holds a special place in my heart.</p>
<hr>
<p>With that, I conclude my gaming journey. A story flooded with nostalgia and admiration for the many games that have lead me to where I am now. There are yet more I would include, but here feels a good place to wrap up. I believe games are truly pieces of art that can mix music, story and visuals in a unique way with player engagement and that the best games are born out of passion, not profit. Video games have had a huge impact on my life and formed the foundation of countless friendships. The power and influence of messages spread in this medium should not be underestimated and I would highly recommend any game in this list to anyone who would consider playing them.</p>
